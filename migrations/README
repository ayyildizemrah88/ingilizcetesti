# Migrations Configuration
# This folder contains database migration files managed by Flask-Migrate (Alembic)
#
# USAGE:
#   Initialize migrations (first time only):
#     flask db init
#
#   Create a new migration:
#     flask db migrate -m "Add new column"
#
#   Apply migrations to database:
#     flask db upgrade
#
#   Rollback last migration:
#     flask db downgrade
#
# IMPORTANT:
#   - Always commit migration files to version control
#   - Test migrations on a copy of production data before deploying
#   - Never edit migrations that have been applied to production
